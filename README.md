# Simple online shop.

I'm start write that project for self purpose. But if anyone else want use it in they own purpose I accept that too.

They written on python3.4 and django1.8 I can give warranty only about that stack. But it can else work good on django1.6 but I'm not tested that.

Project in developing stage and now its don't have some functionality and features. But I'm planning develop that project and maybe soon you can see full functionality online shop based on that project.

I'm try to use in it TDD methodology, and make full coverage of tests for more simple refactoring that project in future.

### Roadmap:

1. Adding unit testing of JavaScripts Ajax requests

2. Adding functionality of processing order

3. Adding payment system

4. Add front end functionality

5. Add authorization for users.
